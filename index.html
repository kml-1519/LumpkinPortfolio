								dynamic charts using multiple authoritative data sources, including the 2017-2021 5-Year
								American Community Survey, Department of Transportation metrics, Environmental
								Protection Agency indicators, and HUD administrative datasets. These dashboards were

							<h4>I conducted a comprehensive site suitability analysis using ArcGIS Pro to identify
								optimal locations for climate-resilient affordable housing on St. Thomas in the U.S.
								Virgin Islands. This multi-criteria evaluation incorporated eight critical factors:
								appropriate slope gradients (prioritizing areas with 0-10% slope), zoning compliance
								(focusing on R-3, R-4, R-5, and B-4 zones), proximity to public transportation (within
								305 feet of bus stops), access to commercial centers (within ¼ mile), and safety from
								four distinct climate hazards (gut flooding, sea level rise, tsunami inundation, and
								storm surge).
								<br><br>Using weighted overlay techniques and the ArcGIS Pro Suitability Modeler, I
								transformed
								complex environmental and social data into actionable development recommendations. The
								analysis revealed the Anna's Retreat estate as the most suitable area for multi-family
								housing development—balancing climate resilience with accessibility to essential
								services. I completed this analysis for the University of Pennsylvania's City Planning
								Studio on St. Thomas's Resilience Plan.

							<h4>I co-authored a white paper for the Department of Housing and Urban

								jurisdictions to address discriminatory housing patterns. The white paper specifically
								demonstrated how environmental hazard exposure disproportionately affects protected

								of these disparities. This work directly informed the Department's approach to
								compliance reviews and technical assistance priorities, helping jurisdictions develop
								more effective fair housing strategies.</h4>

							<h4>I authored a comprehensive policy brief on heirs property - a fractional ownership
								crisis affecting an estimated 440,000 properties valued at $41 billion nationwide. This
								research identified how the absence of estate planning creates an unstable form of
								ownership that disproportionately undermines wealth-building for Black, Latino,
								Hispanic, and low-income households. While at the PolicyCenter, I developed a
								multi-pronged policy framework addressing both prevention and resolution strategies,
								including expanding affordable legal services, creating alternative pathways to verify
								ownership, and strengthening federal programs like the Heirs Property Relending Program.
								The brief has served as an actionable roadmap for policymakers, financial institutions,
								and housing advocates working to preserve generational wealth and housing stability for
								vulnerable communities facing this complex legal challenge.

							<h4>This paper, written for a University of Pennsylvania Land Use Law course, analyzes
